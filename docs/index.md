# RobaseService

RobaseService is a RESTful API wrapper for Firebase Realtime Database - written in untyped Luau - for Roblox Developers seeking an external database service with a simple to use Luau wrapper.

As mentioned, RobaseService seeks to be simple to use, but this is one of two core aims of this project. The second aim is to be an easy replacement to [DataStoreService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/DataStoreService). You can find useful code to help with replacing old DataStore code and transferring data [here](Guide/robase-setup/#transferring-from-datastoreservice).
