!!! warning "Site in progress"
    This website is still a work in progress and changes are being made daily.
    
Robase is a RESTful API wrapper for Firebase Realtime Database - written in untyped Luau - for Roblox Developers seeking an external database service with a simple to use wrapper.

As mentioned, Robase seeks to be simple to use, but this is one of two core aims of this project. The second aim is to be an easy replacement to [DataStoreService](). You can find useful code to help with replacing old DataStore code and transferring data [here](#examples).
