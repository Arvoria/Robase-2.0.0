# Installation

There are two methods to get up and running with Robase.  
For our examples, we will install `RobaseService` into `ReplicatedStorage`. Note, it's okay to install RobaseService wherever you want.

## Method A: Roblox Model (via Roblox Studio)

!!! stop "Caution"
    Roblox Models can be outdated, the suggested installation method is Method B.

    Write documentation for Roblox Model.

## Method B: Filesystem (via Rojo)
+ Go to the [Github Releases](https://github.com/Arvoria/Robase-2.0.0/releases) and download the latest stable release of RobaseService. Save it somewhere meaningful so you only need to download it once.

+ Open your working directory in your preferred IDE and sync your files with an empty studio using [Rojo](https://rojo.space)!

+ Copy the source wherever you wish, ReplicatedStorage is recommended.

+ Continue developing!
